# ShortestSubstring
Given an array arr of unique characters and a string str, the function getShortestUniqueSubstring() returns the shortest substring of the string str that contains all the characters of arr and if such a substring does not exist, it returns an empty string
getShortestUniqueSubstring3.py is code written by me and getShortestSubstring4.py is the implementation of the algorithm that claims to run in O(M + N) complexity
